# üß¨ GWAS Meta-Analysis Tutorial

### üß¨ What is Meta-analysis in GWAS?

In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a meta-analysis is a statistical method where we combine summary statistics from multiple independent studies that looked at the same trait (e.g., height, BMI, disease risk).

Instead of pooling raw genotype/phenotype data (which is often impossible due to privacy or logistics), we take each study‚Äôs results (effect size, SE, P-value per SNP) and aggregate them to produce a single, more powerful estimate.

‚úÖ Why do we do Meta-analysis?

1. Increase statistical power
    - A single GWAS might not have enough participants to detect variants with small effects.
    - By combining studies, we effectively increase sample size ‚Üí better ability to detect true associations.

2. Improve precision of effect size estimates
    - Meta-analysis reduces noise by averaging across studies.
    - Standard errors shrink when more data contributes.

3. Generalize across populations
    - Studies may come from different cohorts (European, African, Asian, etc.).
    - Meta-analysis checks whether associations replicate across diverse backgrounds.

4. Detect heterogeneity
    - Sometimes, a SNP has different effects across populations/studies.
    - Meta-analysis allows testing for heterogeneity (e.g., Cochran‚Äôs Q test, I¬≤ statistic).

5. Avoid raw data sharing issues
    - Instead of sharing sensitive raw genotypes, researchers can share summary stats, which are easier to distribute and harmonize.

This tutorial walks you through performing a **meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics**.  
We will cover: preparation & QC, harmonization, running meta-analysis (with [METAL](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/METAL_Documentation)), diagnostics, and downstream analyses.

We cover:  
1. Preparing input files  
2. Quality control (QC)  
3. Harmonization across studies  
4. Running meta-analysis in METAL  
5. Preparing and visualizing results

## 2. üìÇ Input Data

Each study should provide summary statistics with consistent columns. The minimum required are:  


| Column       | Description                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| SNP          | rsID                                                  |
| CHR          | Chromosome                                            |
| BP           | Base-pair position                                    |
| A1           | Effect allele                                         |
| A2           | Other allele                                          |
| BETA / OR    | Effect size (log-odds for binary traits)              |
| SE           | Standard error of effect size                         |
| P            | P-value                                               |
| N            | Sample size                                           |
| EAF (opt.)   | Effect allele frequency                               |
| INFO (opt.)  | Imputation quality score                              |

## 3. üîç Quality Control (QC)

Each dataset should be QC‚Äôd before meta-analysis:  

1. **Genome build alignment**  
   - Convert all datasets to the same reference genome build (e.g., GRCh37 or GRCh38).  

2. **Variant-level filters**  
   - Remove SNPs with low imputation quality (INFO < 0.8).  
   - Remove rare SNPs (MAF < 0.01).  
   - Exclude multiallelic SNPs and indels if uncertain.  

3. **Consistency checks**  
   - Confirm alleles are A, C, G, or T only.  
   - Ensure effect allele (A1) matches the effect direction.  
   - Remove ambiguous SNPs (A/T or C/G) if strand cannot be determined.  

---

## 4. üîÑ Harmonization

After QC, ensure datasets are harmonized:  

- Rename columns to a consistent format for METAL.  
- Standardize effect allele naming (A1, A2).  
- Align allele orientation across studies.  
- Prepare files in plain text, tab-delimited format.  

---

## 5. üèÉ Running Meta-Analysis in METAL

To run METAL:  

1. Write a control script that specifies:  
   - The **effect size and SE scheme** (`SCHEME STDERR`).  
   - Which columns contain marker, alleles, effect size, SE, p-value, and sample size.  
   - A list of study files to process.  

2. Run METAL with the script.  
   - METAL produces `.tbl` files containing meta-analysis results.

## 6. üìä Preparing Results

METAL‚Äôs output usually contains SNP, effect size, SE, p-value, and weight.  

- It may not include chromosome and position, so merge results with a reference file containing `CHR` and `BP`.  
- Clean the data by ensuring `CHR`, `BP`, and `P` are numeric, and remove missing values.

## 7. üåÜ Visualization

After preparing results, visualization includes:  

- **Manhattan plots** ‚Äî to show genome-wide significance across chromosomes.  
- **QQ plots** ‚Äî to assess inflation of test statistics.  
- **Heterogeneity tests** (optional) ‚Äî to check for inconsistent effects across studies.
